GreenSlate Coding Challenge Interview

This Solution was developed as a  part of coding challenge interview for GreenSlate. 

Notes to Take in Consideration:

 * While the Messages and some other validations of the form were made on the onDocumentReady method, the idea was to use the Ajax methods onSucess but I wasn't able to make it work
 and since currently I've been developed in Java for the past 7 years this was something that with more time would do differently.
 
 * In regards, to the Util Class, at the beginning this class was meant to only receive parameters and not an Object itself but since I had some troubles after binding the values I 
 decided to keep using the the utilClass since at least the model on that way looks cleaner.
